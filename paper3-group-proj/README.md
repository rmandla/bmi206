# Group Project - Paper 3

Here is all of the code we wrote/ran, as well as data acquired and generated while completing our group project. We decided to analyze Figure 3 of this [paper.]('https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2897-z')

### Files
1. iJO1366 Data Summary - Summary of iJO1366 Data Summary dataset and adjacency matrix. Also contains a bunch of additional test code that can be ignored (remove?)

2. EcoliFBA.m - Matlab script, reads in E. coli metabolism SBML and calculates essential reactions using FBA 

3. Paper 3 Figure Generation - uses essential reactions and adjacency matrix to calculate the correlation between % essential reaction and bridging centrality
